Game Jam Theme is Loop

Main character that has the ability to make objects in the game world loop.
Character's abilities are time based that they gain from the world.
2d sidescroller
Character can jump, loop, maybe other things. Think Mario, Rouge Legacy, Castlevania.

Main foe is Ouroboros
Ouroboros has trapped city in a one day loop, player must complete tasks in each loop.


Rougelike components? 
Ability to extend the number of days before loop?
Time Mastery Points gained per loop?

It should be possible for a speedrunner to finish the game in one-two loops if they are skilled but that's for later.
